    <h1>Differnce between Static Typed Languages and Dynamically typed languages in programming</h1>
    <h2>Static type system</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>Type checking is completed at compile time</li>
        <li>Explicit type declarations are usually required</li>
        <li>Errors are detected earlier</li>
        <li>Variable assignments are static and cannot be changed</li>
        <li>Produces more optimized code</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dynamic type system</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Type checking is completed during runtime</li>
        <li>Explicit declarations are not required</li>
        <li>Type errors are detected later during execution</li>
        <li>Variable assignments are dynamic and can be altered</li>
        <li>Produces less optimized code, runtime errors are possible</li>
    </ul>
