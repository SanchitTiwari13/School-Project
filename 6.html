            <p>Wake up to reality! <br> <br> Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. <br> <br>The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and futility. <br> <br>Listenâ€¦ Everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. <br> <br> As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. <br> <br>The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates wars and hatred is born in order to protect love. <br> <br>There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated. </p>
